# Tic-Tac-Toe

A classical game of Tic-Tac-Toe coded in Clojure

## Usage

    $ lein run

## Input Format

You are supposed to enter the cell co-ordinates at which you want to mark, Eg: (0 1), (1 2), etc.

Currently if you enter wrong inputs, let's say (-1 3) or ("a" "b"), the program will crash (working on making it error prone)
